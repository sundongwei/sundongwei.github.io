Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.
女士们，先生们，我本打算今晚向你们报告国情咨文，但今天早些时候发生的事情让我改变了计划。今天是一个哀悼和纪念的日子。南希和我为挑战者号航天飞机的悲剧感到痛心。我们知道，我们和我们国家的所有人一样痛苦。这确实是一个国家的损失。

Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.
19年前的今天，我们在一次可怕的地面事故中失去了3名宇航员。但是，我们从来没有在飞行中失去过宇航员。我们从未经历过这样的悲剧。也许我们已经忘记了航天飞机机组人员所需要的勇气。但是他们，挑战者7号，意识到了这些危险，但是他们克服了这些危险，出色地完成了他们的工作。我们悼念七位英雄:Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka,Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe。我们举国哀悼他们的逝去。

For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, ``Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.'' They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us. We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
对于这七个家庭，我们不能像你们一样，完全承受这场悲剧的影响。但是我们感到了损失，我们非常想念你们。你们的亲人勇敢无畏，他们有一种特殊的风度，一种特殊的精神，那就是，给我一个挑战，我将带着喜悦去迎接它。他们渴望探索宇宙，发现宇宙的真相。他们愿意为国效力，他们也确实这样做了。他们为我们所有人服务。我们已经习惯了这个世纪的奇迹。很难让我们眼花缭乱。但是，25年来，美国太空计划一直在这样做。我们已经习惯了太空的概念，也许我们忘记了我们才刚刚开始。我们仍然先锋。他们，挑战者号机组的成员，是先驱者。

And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.
我想对正在观看航天飞机起飞实况报道的美国学生们说几句话。我知道这很难理解，但有时这种痛苦的事情会发生。这是探索和发现过程的一部分。这都是冒险和拓展人类视野的一部分。未来不属于胆小者;它属于勇敢者。挑战者号机组人员正在把我们带入未来，我们将继续追随他们。
I've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute. We'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue. I want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: `Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.'
我一直对我们的太空计划充满信心和尊重。今天发生的一切丝毫没有削弱它。我们不隐瞒我们的太空计划。我们不会保守秘密或掩盖事实。我们都是在公众面前做的。这就是自由，我们一分钟也不会改变它。我们将继续探索太空。将有更多的航天飞机飞行和更多的航天飞机机组人员，是的，更多的志愿者，更多的平民，更多的教师在太空。这里没有结束;我们的希望和旅程仍在继续。我还想说，我希望我能和每一位在NASA工作的男男女女，或者是为这次任务工作的人交谈，告诉他们:几十年来，你们的奉献精神和专业精神感动了我们，给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们知道你们的痛苦。我们分享它。
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, ``He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.'' Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.
今天真巧。390年前的今天，伟大的探险家弗朗西斯·德雷克爵士在巴拿马海岸的船上去世。一位历史学家后来说，他生在海边，死在海边，葬在海边。

The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and `slipped the surly bonds of earth' to `touch the face of God.'
今天，我们可以说挑战者号的机组人员。像德雷克一样，他们的奉献是彻底的。挑战者号航天飞机的机组人员以他们的生活方式向我们表示敬意。我们永远不会忘记他们，也不会忘记我们最后一次见到他们的时候，今天早上，当他们准备启程，挥手告别，挣脱大地粗暴的束缚，去触摸上帝的脸颊。
